Listas.c: (in function Insere)
Listas.c:21:11: Suspected infinite loop.  No value used in loop test (aux,
                   aux->prox) is modified by test or loop body.
  This appears to be an infinite loop. Nothing in the body of the loop or the
  loop test modifies the value of the loop test. Perhaps the specification of a
  function called in the loop body is missing a modification. (Use -infloops to
  inhibit warning)
Listas.c:29:14: Return expression from function declared void: NULL
  Types are incompatible. (Use -type to inhibit warning)
Listas.c: (in function Mostra)
Listas.c:33:10: Suspected infinite loop.  No value used in loop test (inicio)
                   is modified by test or loop body.
Listas.c: (in function Avanca)
Listas.c:40:9: Return expression from function declared void: inicio
Listas.c:4:13: File static function Avanca declared but not used
  A function is declared but not used. Use /*@unused@*/ in front of function
  header to suppress message. (Use -fcnuse to inhibit warning)
   Listas.c:41:1: Definition of Avanca
Main.c: (in function main)
Main.c:8:9: Passed storage &inicio not completely defined: Inicia (&inicio)
  Storage derivable from a parameter, return value or global is not defined.
  Use /*@out@*/ to denote passed or returned storage which need not be defined.
  (Use -compdef to inhibit warning)
Main.c:10:10: Function Get_C expects arg 1 to be int * gets int: tamanho
Main.c:10:3: Return value (type char *) ignored: Get_C(tamanho)
  Result returned by function call is not used. If this is intended, can cast
  result to (void) to eliminate message. (Use -retvalother to inhibit warning)
